============

This project aims to produce a creature with 6 legs and must run without anyone's help.

Some of you may be familiar with the late 90’s tv show “F/X” where the main character (working with special effect) was getting the help of a small but smart robot named “Bleuet” (in French). This show sparkled the idea of creating a matte for Bleuet, that will be called “Bleuette”.

See the announcement of the resumption of development: http://www.digitalspirit.org/blog/index.php/post/2012/08/06/Le-retour-de-l-hexapode-Bleuette
